# @transmute/json-web-signature

This suite requires you be able to overwrite

`https://w3id.org/security/v2`

Not all JSON-LD tooling allows you to do this... see [documentLoader.ts](./src/__fixtures__/documentLoader.ts)

Recommend using https://github.com/transmute-industries/vc.js with this library until other tools migtate to:

`https://w3id.org/security/v3`.
